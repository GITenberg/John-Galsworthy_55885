  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A characteristic of every age
is its group of popular writers.
These writers at once concentrate
and give out the spirit of their age—they
are representative. Literature has many
names of pioneers and apostles, who were
ahead of or out of sympathy with their
times, but these were never popular. The
popular writer is essentially a man who
conforms to his period; it is true that his
conformity must have life and vigour, it
must have nothing in it of the echo or the
slave, it may even be disguised rather
transparently as revolt—but whatever enterprises
and excursions he allows himself, he
remembers that there are certain bases which
he must keep, and to which after every
expedition he must come back. These bases
are either the conventional ideas of his time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>or the conventional methods of attacking
them—the two are for such purposes the
same.</p>

<p class='c001'>So a glance at our most popular modern
writers ought to give us a clue as to the
spirit of to-day. But here there is something
baffling—we find names as far apart
as H. G. Wells and Florence Barclay, Arnold
Bennett and Hall Caine. Surely the spirit
of the age is not broad enough to include
both Joseph Conrad and Marie Corelli.
This brings us face to face with a modern
complication: we have two publics. The
spread of education, with other causes, has
brought into being a mob-public, and the
approved of the mob-public have a popularity
which could hardly have been realised
two generations ago. The most popular
writer of to-day is he whose appeal is to the
man in the street, and the largest sales are
made by those who are most successful in
catering for this newly enfranchised reader—with
whom literature and art have not
hitherto had much truck, but with whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>they will have to reckon more and more as
time goes on.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, a public above the
street, and this is large and important
enough to allow those who write for it to
call themselves popular. This public grants
its favour on grounds literary as well as
emotional--it is not enough to stir its feelings,
one must tickle its taste. It is fundamentally
the same as the mob in its ideas,
but it is very different in its methods of
criticism. The mob likes to see its prejudices
upheld, this public above the street—which
is the public that most writers of any
“literary” aspiration supply—while holding
the same prejudices as strongly at heart,
rather enjoys seeing them overthrown on
paper. At the same time it demands
artistic quality, reality, and an occasional
shock. While not actually <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>gourmet</em></span>, it is
fastidious in the matter of literary fare,
and it is characteristically split up into
cliques or smaller publics, each swearing
by a particular writer, just as men who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>are nice as to food swear by a particular
restaurant. There is a Wells public, differing
slightly if not essentially from the
Bennett public; there is a Kipling public—with
democratic foundations; there is a
Conrad public, and a Galsworthy public—and
the Galsworthy public is perhaps the
smallest of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed Galsworthy can hardly be called
a “popular” writer. I am not using the
word in a contemptuous sense, but to describe
a writer who is widely read. Galsworthy
will never be widely read, for he
alienates two important sets of readers—those
who insist that a book shall teach
them something, and those who with equal
force insist that it shall teach them nothing.
He fails the first class because, while supplying
its demands, he does not satisfy the
conditions it imposes. He undoubtedly
has something to teach, but he avoids the
direct appeal, which is what the public
wants. Direct and open championship is
the only way of making a cause popular—let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>us be broad-minded, by all means, but
agreeing that “there may be something to
say on the other side” is very different from
finding out what that something is, and
saying it. Also he is too sensitive, too
moderate, too well balanced to please the
“improvement-above-all-things” reader,
whose perceptions are not of the subtlest.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, he puts himself out of
touch with those who do not want to be
taught, because he undoubtedly has a propaganda,
and is not an artist purely for art’s
sake. Between himself and the numbers who
would unhesitatingly admire him as a man
of letters he raises the barrier of ideas which,
while too subtly expressed to satisfy those who
clamour for instruction, are quite decided
enough to cut off those who object to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus Galsworthy’s public is whittled down
to those who either are in sympathy with
his aims and methods—and there must be
few who understand both—or are able to
swallow a small amount of propaganda for
the sake of art. He sets out to write
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>deliberately for no man—he does not recruit
his readers, they are volunteers. They
come to him from widely different camps,
and concentrate in an admiration which is
perhaps as full of reserves as its object.</p>

<p class='c001'>He has deliberately rejected all public-snatching
tricks, revealing his personality
in his work alone, avoiding the light of
popular curiosity and journalistic enterprise.
He has treated his private life as his
own concern, not as a bait for readers. A
judicious use of his own personality and
private affairs is, broadly speaking, indispensable
to the seeker after popularity.
Galsworthy, by disliking this, has necessarily
limited his public to those who read him
for his work’s sake.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the bare facts of his life that he chooses
to give we shall find nothing so interesting
as what we find in his books and plays.
Born in 1867, at Coombe in Surrey, he was
educated at Harrow and at Oxford. He was
called to the Bar in 1890, but practised
very little.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>He has travelled a great deal, and widely—America
and Egypt, Canada and the
Cape, British Columbia and Australia,
Russia and the Fiji Islands. It was on the
sailing ship which carried him from Adelaide
to South Africa twenty-two years ago that
he made friends with a sailor who now, as
Joseph Conrad, has a fame equal to Galsworthy’s
own. It is remarkable that, in
spite of these wide wanderings, his plays
and novels should almost invariably have
an English background. Seldom, if ever,
does he go afield, and then it is only to
some place more or less known to everyone,
such as Austria in <cite>Villa Rubein</cite>, <cite>The Dark
Flower</cite>, and <cite>The Little Dream</cite>. He has never,
like Conrad, given us the fruit of his voyagings
on the far seas, or his tracks over
Russian and Canadian plains.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps this may be due to the fact that
no matter how far he may have wandered,
his roots are English. Though born in
Surrey, he is a Devon man. Galsworthy is
of course a well-known Devon name, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>for many years now he has lived in Devon,
on the eastern rim of Dartmoor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again and again he gives Devon to us—there
is <cite>A Man of Devon</cite>, with its tender
freshness of the Devon soil sweetening the
strength of Devon hardihood; there is <cite>A Bit
o’ Love</cite>, with its living and poetic conception
of Place; and there is <cite>The Patrician</cite>, with all
the breadth of the moors in contrast with
the littleness of human passion and human
reasoning. Again, too, in <cite>Riding in Mist</cite>, we
have a picture of a mood of the Devon tors
which has seldom been equalled and never
surpassed. Also his <cite>Moods, Songs and
Doggerels</cite> is full of the county, its scenery, its
men and women, its dialect, its rains, its
“heather gipsy” wind. Though Galsworthy
is certainly not an interpreter of place, though
his great novels and plays deal with the
mysteries of human nature rather than with
local subtleties—and the atmosphere he sheds
over his work is general rather than particular,
the spirit rather than the ghost—one feels
that Devon is the background of his dreams.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE PLAYS <br /> I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Galsworthy takes his place in
modern literature chiefly by virtue
of his plays. Criticism may to a
certain extent damage him as a novelist,
but the most searching critics cannot leave
him anything less than a great playwright.
His talents are specially adapted to the
dramatic form, which at the same time does
much to veil his weak points. His mastery
of technique nowhere shows to greater advantage
than on the stage, nor has he better
scope for his true sense of situation; on the
other hand, the stage is a legitimate field
for propaganda, and the occasional failure
of the human interest in his work can be
made good by the ability of the actor.</p>

<p class='c001'>For Galsworthy’s plays have the advantage
of acting well—unlike much literary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>drama, they are as effective on the stage as
in the study; in fact, they gain by acting,
because, as I said, he has a tendency now
and then to subordinate the human interest
to the moral, and this the actor can make
good.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stands midway between the purely
literary and the purely popular playwright,
and he also occupies middle ground between
drama which is entirely for instruction
and that which is for amusement only.
Poles apart on one hand from the light
comedies of H. H. Davies and Somerset
Maugham, he has very little in common
with stage preachers such as Shaw and
Barker. More polished and more subtle
than Houghton, he is less clear-eyed and
heroic than Masefield. Undoubtedly his
most striking quality as a dramatist is his
sense of form and craft, but he is far removed
from that school of playwrights, of
which Pinero and H. A. Jones are leaders,
whose technique amounts to little more
than a working knowledge of the stage.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Galsworthy loves, in his novels as well
as his plays, to deal with situations. This
is to a certain extent detrimental to the
novelist, as it hampers development, and a
novel which does not develop along some
line or other has a tendency to stale or
solidify. But it is obvious that a sense of
situation is one of the first essentials of a
dramatist, and Galsworthy has it in full
measure. It shows pre-eminently in his
central ideas, and subordinately in his apt
management of his curtains, which in his
best plays are situations in themselves,
epitomising the chief issues of the act or
scene.</p>

<p class='c001'>His central situation is the moral or social
problem at the bottom of the play. He
carries on his propaganda almost entirely
by situation, and this is what lifts his art
above that of Shaw and other missionary
dramatists. He practically never relies
on dialogue for introducing his theories,
except so far as dialogue develops and
explains the situation. He depends on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>characters and their actions to enforce his
moral, and it is to this he owes his artistic
salvation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having chosen his situation, he proceeds
to balance it with two contrasting groups,
one on either side. Each group consists of
various types, embodying various points
of view, which, while differing to a slight
extent, are yet subordinate to the Point of
View of the group. The fact that his characters
are types rather than individuals is
all to his good as a dramatist, though we
shall see later that it is a drawback in the
novels. Types are always more convincing
on the stage than individuals, the necessary
personal touch being given by the actor.
There is no use criticising a play apart from
the acting—the two are inextricably bound
together, so that the author is in a sense
only the collaborator; a play which was
not written to be acted can scarcely be
called a play—it is a novel in dialogue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the best example of Galsworthy’s
technique, and at the same time his finest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>achievement as a playwright, is <cite>Strife</cite>. Here
we have the central situation, the contrasting
of groups, the combination of types—the
whole so perfectly balanced, and so
smooth-working, that it does not creak once.
The central idea is the dispute between the
directors of the Works and their employees,
but it is impossible to consider this in itself,
apart from the attitude of the two parties
towards it. Indeed we are given a very
vague idea of the nature of the difference;
all we know is that it has reduced many
of the workers to starvation, while the
directors have to face angry shareholders and
failing dividends. Harness, the trades-union
delegate, acts as a go-between, and gradually
both groups begin to see the allurements
of compromise. Various circumstances
drive them towards it, with the exception
of their respective leaders, Roberts, and old
Anthony. The end is pitiful—for the two
sides surrender to each other simultaneously,
breaking their leaders’ hearts. These men
are of extraordinary character and ability,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and of the most splendid courage, but they
are betrayed by their cowardly followers,
who have not grit or faith enough to see
that their only chance lies in “no compromise.”
There is a powerful scene between
Roberts, the men’s leader, and
Anthony, chairman of the directors, when
they have both been abandoned by their
supporters:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Roberts</span> [<em>to</em> <span class='sc'>Anthony</span>]. But <em>ye</em> have not
signed them terms! They can’t make
terms without their chairman! Ye would
never sign them terms! [<span class='sc'>Anthony</span> <em>looks
at him without speaking</em>.] Don’t tell me ye
have! for the love o’ God [<em>with passionate
appeal</em>] I reckoned on ye!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Harness</span> [<em>holding out the Directors’ copy
of the terms</em>]. The <em>Board</em> has signed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Roberts</span>. Then you’re no longer Chairman
of this Company! [<em>Breaking into half-mad
laughter</em>.] Ah, ha—Ah, ha, ha!
They’ve thrown ye over—thrown over their
Chairman: ah—ha—ha! [<em>With a sudden
dreadful calm.</em>] So—they’ve done us both
down, Mr Anthony.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>There is also a social problem at the
bottom of <cite>Justice</cite>, but this time it is in
connection with the English law. In <cite>Justice</cite>
we have a bitter, tragic indictment of the
penal system. We are given the psychology
of a crime, but not so much of its committal
as of its expiation. We are shown the effect
of prison life on the clerk Falder, and of its
consequences following him after his release,
and driving him at last to suicide. It is
a wonderfully temperate statement of cruel
facts. Throughout it Galsworthy retains
a perfect command of his art; above all
he avoids any cheap identification of the
ministers of a system with the system itself.
The officials of the court and of the prison are
all shown as wise and humane men; they do
their best, according to their powers, for
those wretches whose lives are harassed by
the system they administrate. It is the
system alone which is in fault.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps Galsworthy has made a mistake
in choosing Falder as his victim. The man
is of a type which would go under with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>very slight push, weak and changeable,
an extreme case. On the other hand, he
shows the effect of Law on the poor and weak
it is ostensibly there to protect. He is one
of those for whom Justice, as understood
in this country, and indeed most countries,
makes no provision. He is a special case,
and it is characteristic of systems and institutions
that they ignore—are to a certain
extent forced to ignore—the special case,
which is almost always better worth considering
than the general mass to which the
system is adapted. Galsworthy suggests
no remedy, no alternative. He does not
hint anywhere that Falder has been badly
treated. He has been treated as well as
Justice will allow; as many men are the
victims of injustice, so is he the victim of
justice itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The play is not quite so well constructed
as <cite>Strife</cite>. The first and second acts cover
mostly the same ground, and the action is
not so compact or the climax so inevitable.
On the other hand, there are some fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>scenes, and some particularly arresting
characters. Cokeson, the little kind-hearted,
humble-minded clerk, is a lovable person,
and the relations between Falder and
Ruth Honeywill are studied with exquisite
delicacy and pathos. The scene of Falder’s
arrest, of his trial, and that terrible silent
scene, in which not a word is spoken, but in
which we are shown far more powerfully
than by any words, the horror, the misery,
the madness, of solitary confinement—are
all memorable, and make us forgive a certain
scrappiness in their succession. The play
ends on a fine note of tragedy, when Falder,
re-arrested for obtaining employment by
a forged character, throws himself downstairs
rather than go back to gaol:</p>

<p class='c009'><cite>Justice</cite> and <cite>Strife</cite> both deal with social and
economic questions in the larger sense, but
in the majority of the plays the issues are
more personal. <cite>The Silver Box</cite> and <cite>The
Eldest Son</cite>, for instance, both show the
different standards of morality expected from
the poor and from the rich. <cite>The Fugitive</cite>
is a study of the helplessness of a beautiful
woman, not specially trained, when she is
driven to make her own way in life. <cite>Joy</cite>
shows the essential selfishness which we all
bring into our relations both with one
another and with problems of conduct.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Silver Box</cite> runs <cite>Strife</cite> close as Galsworthy’s
masterpiece. There is a strong
resemblance between its central idea and
that of <cite>The Eldest Son</cite>, a far inferior play.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>In <cite>The Silver Box</cite> the charwoman’s husband
is sent to gaol for stealing, whereas the M.P.’s
son, who has also committed a theft, under
far more unforgivable circumstances, escapes
because of his superior position and wealth....
In <cite>The Eldest Son</cite>, the poor gamekeeper is
threatened with dismissal if he will not marry
the girl he has betrayed, while the eldest
son of the house brings his father’s wrath
upon his head for standing by the lady’s
maid he has put in the same position.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Silver Box</cite> is much the clearer-sighted
of the two plays; in the second the issues
are occasionally confused, and both the
construction and dramatic effect are inferior.
<cite>The Silver Box</cite> is practically flawless. The
two contrasting groups, the rich and important
Barthwicks, and the poor, good-for-nothing
Joneses, are perfectly balanced.
There is no crude over-emphasis of the situation,
nor inopportune enforcement of the
moral, though perhaps in the trial scene
Galsworthy is a little too anxious to point
out the similarity of the positions of Jack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Barthwick and Jem Jones, and the difference
of their treatment: “Dad! that’s
what you said to me!” says young Barthwick,
more pointedly than naturally, when
the magistrate tells Jones he is “a nuisance
to the community.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The characters are drawn with great
vividness and restraint. Mrs Jones is particularly
successful—pale, quiet, down-trodden,
she has about her a certain dignified
pathos which is perfectly human and natural.
She does not pose as a martyr, she does not
pretend that she would not leave her husband
if she could and dared; the fact is not hidden
from us that her sad-eyed silences must be
particularly irritating to him. She does not
complain over much, but she has nothing of
stoical endurance—she endures rather because
she has been battered into submission
and sees the uselessness of revolt. She
would revolt if she could.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most direct and convincing
scenes in the play is that between these two,
in their home, when Mrs Jones discovers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>that her husband has stolen the silver
box.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> I’ve had a bit of luck. Picked up
a purse—seven pound and more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> Oh, James!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> Oh, James! What about oh,
James! I picked it up, I tell you. This is
lost property, this is.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> But isn’t there a name in it
or something?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> Name! No, there ain’t no name.
This don’t belong to such as ’ave visitin’
cards. This belongs to a perfec’ lidy. Tike
an’ smell it. Now, you tell me what I
ought to have done. You tell me that.
You can always tell me what I ought to
ha’ done.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> I can’t say what you ought
to have done, James. Of course the money
wasn’t yours; you’ve taken somebody
else’s money.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> Finding’s keeping. I’ll take it as
wages for the time I’ve gone about the
streets asking for what’s my rights. I’ll
take it for what’s <em>overdue</em>, d’ye hear? I’ve
got money in my pocket, my girl. Money
in my pocket! And I’m not going to waste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>it. With this ’ere money I’m going to
Canada. I’ll let you have a pound. You’ve
often talked of leavin’ me. You’ve often
told me I treat you badly—well I ’ope you’ll
be glad when I’m gone.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> You have treated me very
badly, James, and of course I can’t prevent
your going; but I can’t tell whether I shall
be glad when you’re gone.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> It’ll change my luck. I’ve ’ad
nothing but bad luck since I took up with
you. And you’ve ’ad no bloomin’ picnic.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> Of course it would have been
better for us if we had never met. We
weren’t meant for each other. But you’re
set against me, that’s what you are, and
you have been for a long time. And you
treat me so badly, James, going after that
Rosie and all. You don’t ever seem to
think of the children that I’ve had to bring
into the world, and of all the trouble I’ve
had to keep them, and what’ll become of
them when you’re gone.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> If you think I want to leave the
little beggars you’re bloomin’ well mistaken.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> Of course I know you’re
fond of them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> Well then, you stow it, old girl.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The kids’ll get along better with you than
when I’m here. If I’d ha’ known as much
as I do now, I’d never ha’ had one o’ them.
What’s the use o’ bringin’ ’em into a state
o’ things like this? It’s a crime, that’s what
it is; but you find it out too late; that’s
what’s the matter with this ’ere world.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> Of course it would have been
better for them, poor little things; but
they’re your own children, and I wonder at
you talkin’ like that. I should miss them
dreadfully if I was to lose them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> And you ain’t the only one. If
I make money out there—--[<em>Looking up he
sees her shaking out his coat—in a changed
voice.</em>] Leave that coat alone!</p>

<p class='c014'>[<em>The silver box drops from the pocket,
scattering the cigarettes upon the bed.

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> Oh, Jem! Oh, Jem!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> You mind what you’re sayin’!
When I go out I’ll take and chuck it in the
water along with that there purse. I ’ad
it when I was in liquor, and for what you
do when you’re in liquor you’re not responsible—and
that’s Gawd’s truth as you ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>to know. I don’t want the thing—I won’t
have it. I took it out o’ spite. I’m no
thief, I tell you; and don’t you call me one,
or it’ll be the worse for you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> It’s Mr Barthwick’s! You’ve
taken away my reputation. Oh, Jem,
whatever made you?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> What d’you mean?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> It’s been missed; they think
it’s me. Oh, whatever made you do it,
Jem?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> I tell you I was in liquor. I don’t
want it; what’s the good of it to me? If I
were to pawn it they’d only nab me. I’m
no thief. I’m no worse than what young
Barthwick is; he brought ’ome that purse
I picked up—a lady’s purse—’ad it off ’er in

I scored ’im off. Tight as an owl ’e was!

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mrs Jones.</span> Oh, Jem! It’s the bread
out of our mouths.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Jones.</span> Is it, then? I’ll make it hot for
’em yet. What about that purse. What
about young Barthwick.</p>

<p class='c009'>In <cite>The Eldest Son</cite> we have the same idea
not quite so effectively handled—the contrast
between the codes of ethics required
from the poor and from the rich. There
are some good scenes in the play, notably
that between Bill and Freda in the first
act, and that towards the end, when the
whole Cheshire family is brought into action
against Freda and her sturdy old father, who
at last suddenly solves the difficulty by
saying: “I’ll have no charity marriage in
my family,” and leading his daughter away.
Also the characters of Sir William Cheshire
and of his wife are great achievements,
both strong and delicate. But the play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>has not the grip or the reality of <cite>The Silver
Box</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The failure lies in a certain lack of
cohesion and inevitableness in the whole.
The rehearsal of <cite>Caste</cite>, which is introduced
in the second act, points the moral rather
too obviously. Also the central idea is
hampered by the fact that the two illustrative
cases are not really parallel. In <cite>The
Silver Box</cite> the theft by young Barthwick is
just as blameworthy as that by Jones.
Their positions are quite the same, except
that, indeed, it is the man of wealth who is
the more despicable and deserving of punishment.
But no one can say that Bill
Cheshire and Freda Studdenham are in
the same position as the gamekeeper and
the village girl. There are objections to the
marriage of Bill and Freda which do not
exist in the other case. Certainly there
are objections to that too, but the fact
remains that the two examples are not
parallel.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>THE PLAYS <br /> II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There are social and economic ideas
at the bottom of <cite>The Fugitive</cite>,
which is to a certain extent symbolical—a
study of woman’s position when,
for any reason, she is separated from the
herd. But in this, as in other of his later
plays, Galsworthy’s command of his art is
not equal to his enthusiasm for his subject.
Moving and forcible as it all is, it has not
the balance, the inevitableness, of <cite>Strife</cite> or
<cite>The Silver Box</cite>. We feel that events are
being arranged to suit the basic theory.
The career of Clare Dedmond, from her
revolt to her downfall, is not a thing foreseen,
a thing of fate. We feel somehow that
her end is arbitrary—at all events we are not
shown the steps that lead to it. The actual
catastrophes we witness do not demand it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>None the less the study of Clare is arresting—the
woman who is “fine, but not fine
enough.” She alienates our sympathies a
little in the first act; there is no denying
that she behaves childishly, and her husband,
uncongenial as he may be, is not quite such
a bounder as Malise, in whom, apparently,
she finds satisfaction. But somehow that
whole first act has an air of unreality about
it, a remoteness from life, and a staginess
we do not expect from Galsworthy. Later
on the movement becomes swifter, and we
have the sense of impending tragedy, which
is realised in the scene where Clare leaves
Malise, though she loves him and he is her
only protector, because she discovers that
she has become a drag on him and is spoiling
his career.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scene at the Restaurant, too, has its
fine points, <a id='corr36.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='thought'>though</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_36.19'><ins class='correction' title='thought'>though</ins></a></span> it is spoilt by a riot of
symbolism and a tendency towards false
sentiment. The continuous singing of “This
Day a Stag must die” by the revellers at
another table is rather an obvious and cheap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>effect, so too the courtesan’s kiss as the
curtain falls. On the whole one feels that
<cite>The Fugitive</cite> is a play in which the author’s
plan has been better conceived than carried
out.</p>

<p class='c001'>The central situations of <cite>Joy</cite> and of <cite>The
Mob</cite> have nothing to do with any social or
economic problem, even in a narrowed,
personal sense. They deal with conduct,
and special cases of conduct. <cite>Joy</cite> and <cite>The
Mob</cite>, with <cite>A Bit o’ Love</cite>, stand at the bottom
of the scale at the top of which are <cite>Justice</cite>
and <cite>Strife</cite>. The interest of the two latter is
centred in the social and industrial problems
they are built on; then come <cite>The Silver
Box</cite>, <cite>The Eldest Son</cite>, and <cite>The Fugitive</cite>, in
which the social problem undoubtedly exists,
but which depend for interest on its personal
variations; then come <cite>Joy</cite>, <cite>The Mob</cite>, and
<cite>A Bit o’ Love</cite>, in which the interest is purely
personal and unconnected with any social
idea.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>Joy</cite> is a play built round an attitude rather
than a problem. “A Play on the Letter I”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>is the sub-title, and from first to last we see
how the consideration of self is the governing
motive of widely different characters.
We see it working openly, in characters
that are frankly and aggressively egotistic;
we see it acting more subtly in characters
of a different stamp. The one person who
is free from it is the old governess, Miss
Beech, who lives only in her interest in
those around her. Somehow, as is often the
case with characters purposely in contrast
with his general scheme, Galsworthy is
occasionally artificial in dealing with Miss
Beech. Her “devilishness” is more than
once a trifle forced—the author so obviously
wants her to be original, unlike both the
conventional stage governess, and the conventionally
selfless person. She fills to a
certain extent the position of Chorus, and
her vocation takes from her humanity.
She becomes, as the play goes on, more and
more of a Voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, there is a great deal of
humanity about Joy herself and her mother.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Mrs Gwyn’s lover, Maurice Lever, is also
real enough, though the same cannot always
be said of Joy’s Dick. The scenes between
the young people ring true, but the boy
loses reality when away from Joy; he
becomes more a part of stage machinery.</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of some languors, the play is
quick-moving and closely knit, and the
author keeps the central situation well in
hand. There are one or two haunting scenes—the
scenes of young love between Joy and
Dick, the scenes of older, sadder love, more
passionate and more disillusioned, between
Mrs Gwyn and Lever—and one particularly
good scene between Mrs Gwyn and Joy,
after the girl has discovered her mother’s
secret.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Joy</span> [<em>covering her face</em>]. I’m—I’m
ashamed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> I brought you into the world;
and you say that to me? Have I been a
bad mother to you?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Joy.</span> Oh, mother!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> Ashamed? Am <em>I</em> to live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>all my life like a dead woman because you’re
ashamed? Am I to live like the dead
because you’re a child that knows nothing
of life?... D’you think—because I
suffered when you were born and because
I’ve suffered since with every ache you ever
had, that gives you the right to dictate to
me now? I’ve been unhappy enough, and
I shall be unhappy enough in the time to
come. Oh, you untouched things, you’re
as hard and cold as iron.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Joy.</span> I would do anything for <em>you</em>, mother.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> Except—let me live, Joy.
That’s the only thing you won’t do for me,
I quite understand.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Joy</span> [<em>in a despairing whisper</em>]. But it’s
wrong of you—it’s wicked.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> If it’s wicked, <em>I</em> shall pay for
it, not <em>you</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Joy.</span> But I want to save you, mother!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> Save me? [<em>Breaking into
laughter.</em>]</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Joy.</span> I can’t bear it that <em>you</em>—if you’ll
only—I’ll never leave you ... oh, mother!
I feel—I feel <em>so awful</em>—as if everybody knew.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> You think I’m a monster to
hurt you. Ah! yes! You’ll understand
better some day.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><span class='sc'>Joy</span> [<em>in a sudden burst of excited fear</em>]. I
won’t believe it—I—I—can’t—<em>you’re deserting
me</em>, mother.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> Oh, you untouched things!
You—--</p>
<p class='c013'>[<span class='sc'>Joy</span> <em>looks up suddenly, sees her face,
and sinks down on her knees</em>.]</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Joy.</span> Mother—it’s for <em>me</em>!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> Ask for my life, Joy—don’t

<p class='c013'>[<span class='sc'>Joy</span> <em>turns her face away</em>. <span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn</span>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Mrs Gwyn.</span> I forgot—I’m deserting you.</p>
<p class='c013'>[<em>And swiftly without looking back she

<p class='c009'><cite>The Mob</cite> is rather an irritating, unsatisfactory
play. It is meant to be a study in
ideals, but it is astonishing how blunderingly
and at the same time how coldly Galsworthy
puts these ideals before us. The title is also
a mistake. The attitude of the mob towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Stephen More is merely of secondary and
artificial importance. He meets his death
at its hands, it is true, but it plays little
part in the spiritual fight he wages. The
exhibition, in a final tableau, of its changing
fancy—in the statue it erects to his memory—is
dangerously near anti-climax, and no
integral part of the whole. One cannot see
that the mob is anywhere a dominant force—it
is an incident, far less important here
than in <cite>Strife</cite>, though there is one scene in
which Galsworthy shows again, as he showed
in <cite>Strife</cite>, his power of dealing with stage
crowds:</p>
<p class='c015'>[<span class='sc'>More</span> <em>turns and mounts the steps</em>.]</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Tall Youth.</span> You blasted traitor.</p>

<p class='c013'>[<span class='sc'>More</span> <em>faces round at the volley of jeering
that follows; the chorus of booing
swells, then gradually dies, as if they
realised that they were spoiling their
own sport</em>.]</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>A Rough Girl.</span> Don’t frighten the poor
feller.</p>

<p class='c013'>[<em>A girl beside her utters a shrill laugh.</em>]</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>More.</span> Well, what do you want?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><span class='sc'>Voice.</span> A speech.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>More.</span> Indeed! That’s new.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Rough Voice.</span> Look at his white liver.
You can see it in his face.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>A Big Navvy.</span> Shut it. Give ’im a chanst.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Tall Youth.</span> Silence for the blasted
traitor?</p>

<p class='c013'>[<em>A youth plays on the concertina; there
is laughter, then an abrupt silence.</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'>... and so on.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole of this scene is vigorous and
convincing, so too the scene of More’s death;
but again and again we are irritated by the
way Galsworthy misses his chances. Take,
for instance, the scene in which Katherine
uses her beauty and his love for her to tempt
More from his ideal—it is full of magnificent
opportunities, and there is some fine stuff
in it, but somehow it misses fire. This may
be partly due to the fact that in his later
plays Galsworthy’s restraint occasionally
seems to lose its force. Economy of words
and emotion is effective only when used to
control the riches of both.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><cite>A Bit O’ Love</cite> is in a sense the most personal
of all the plays—I say in a sense, because,
for the first time, we find Galsworthy definitely
exploiting Place. The importance
of Place in literature is a comparatively
new discovery, for we must not count the
descriptive and local novels which have been
with us more or less from the first. Studies
in Place, which set out deliberately to bring
forward the personality—if I may use the
term—of Place, are only just beginning, and
Galsworthy, with <cite>A Bit O’ Love</cite>, comes among
the pioneers. It is his latest play, and it
will be interesting to watch if he chooses to
develop along this line.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have the Devonshire village as a
central character in the piece—the various
types which compose it are just so many
parts of the whole, and it would be a mistake
to treat them as separate persons. The
village is at once sturdy and sweet and
foolish, it is curious, it is pig-headed—it is
built of the wisps of moon-and-dew cobwebs,
and of the sty-door stakes from which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>float. It is the common life of the village
which is dealt with here, rather than
subtleties of atmosphere—the actual locality
has no definite existence apart from its
inhabitants, which is a milder practice of the
art of Place. But the central idea is the
same as in all Place studies—the effect of
the Place on the Man.</p>

<p class='c001'>The man here is Michael Strangway,
curate of the village, “a gentle creature
burnt within,” who plays the flute, and
loves dumb animals, and acts St Francis
without the adorable Franciscan coarseness.
His wife pleads with him not to ruin her
lover’s career by bringing a divorce, and
for love of her he promises. Unfortunately
the interview is overheard by a little gossiping
village girl who has a grudge against
him because he had set free her imprisoned
skylark. The news is spread, and the
village is righteously indignant, wrath
culminating when the curate crowns his
impious toleration by falling upon the man
who has used a few plain words about his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>wife in a public-house. Attacked and
shunned on all sides for his attempt at a
literal gospel, and betrayed within by the
ache and emptiness of his heart, the curate
resolves on suicide, but is rather tritely
saved at the last moment by the little
che-ild of such occasions, who offers him
“a bit o’ love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There is some good work in the play, an
atmosphere of beautiful wistfulness, tenderly
combined with the bumpkin clump and flit.
The dance in the big barn has its full effect
of mystic and rustic beauty; there is infinite
pathos in Strangway and Cremer
setting out for a long tramp together in the
link of their bruised hearts—and Galsworthy
has done nothing more kindly-humorous
than the meeting at the village inn, with Sol
Potter uneasily in the chair.</p>

<p class='c001'>The play is beautifully written, but it
would seem as if the author had scarcely a
clear idea himself of Strangway, and a little
more planning might have saved him
from one or two banalities. The extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>individuality, so to speak, of the curate’s
problem—for no one can deny that his was
an exceptional case—is a bit in the way of
a writer whose chief concern is the social
and general. But we must give a particular
welcome to <cite>A Bit o’ Love</cite>, because it is
Galsworthy’s first real experiment in Place,
and one has a feeling that here is a grand
new road for him to tread.</p>

<p class='c001'>There remain two plays, which are called
respectively “A Fantasy” and “An
Allegory”—<cite>The Pigeon</cite> and <cite>The Little
Dream</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first is a fantasy based on sober facts.
Indeed it would be rightly called a satire.
It is a study—carried through in a spirit of
comedy, in spite of drunkenness, vice,
poverty, and suicide—of three irreclaimables,
and of those who would reclaim them.
Old Timson, the drunkard; Mrs Megan,
born light of love, who even while drowning
thinks of dancing; Ferrand, the vagabond,
the wanderer of quaint philosophy—they are
a fantastic trio, because the sorrow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>sordidness of their lives is all hazed over by
this half-comic, half-satiric glow in which
their creator chooses to see them. In themselves
more hopeless and tragic than any of
the characters in <cite>Strife</cite> or <cite>Justice</cite>, they raise
smiles instead of tears. It would seem
almost as if the tragedy of the outcast had
stirred in Galsworthy those depths beyond
sorrow, which can find no expression save in
laughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Various theorists argue about these three
outcasts, and one good-natured man befriends
them. Wellwyn is a kindly study,
and his easy methods, however much his
practical little daughter may blame him,
do more to humanise the poor wretches than
the sterner tactics of Professor Calway or
Sir Thomas Huxton. But as a matter of
fact no generosity will meet the case, no
theory. We can only laugh, and through
laughter learn a little more of pity.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is some delightful humour in <cite>The
Pigeon</cite>. As a rule Galsworthy’s humour is
too deeply tinged with bitterness to ring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>true; when it is not embittered it is often
ineffective or trivial, as in <cite>Joy</cite> or <cite>The Eldest
Son</cite>. In <cite>The Pigeon</cite>, however, there are
scenes of genuine humour and fine satire,
both in situation and in dialogue. The various
conceptions of character too are essentially
humorous, which is seldom, if ever, the
case in the other plays. It is a sharp
stroke which right at the end of the play
avenges the kindly Pigeon whom everyone
has plucked.</p>

<p class='c009'><cite>The Little Dream</cite> is rather a bitter allegory

the world, and the Cow Horn, typifying
the pleasures of her mountain home, but
there is a strange resemblance in the hard
disillusions they are bound to offer after their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>gifts, and only the lonely Great Horn behind
points to something finer and higher. There
is really not much interest, or indeed, much
originality in the little sketch, but there is
some beautiful language, and Galsworthy
is able to give free rein to his sense of words
and poetic faculty. There is real poetry in
some of the lyrics, and by them, rather than
by his published volume of verse, one judges
him poet as well as playwright.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE NOVELS <br /> I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Though undoubtedly Galsworthy
owes his position as an artist and as
a thinking force to his plays, he still
carries considerable weight as both in his
novels. That his novels have not the value,
whether social or literary, of his plays—that
indeed his position as a novelist is largely
due to his fame as a playwright—does not
make away with the fact that he has given
us some half-dozen novels of standing, which
are worth consideration in themselves, apart
from anything their author may have done
in other fields.</p>

<p class='c001'>His lack of complete success as a novelist
is partly due to those characteristics which
have made him so successful as a playwright.
The drama is a lawful means of propaganda,
the novel is not—Galsworthy’s plays gain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>enormously from the social or moral problems
at their base, while the same problems
have a tendency to constrict or impede the
development of his novels. A play is dependent
mainly on its craft, for this is a
point which lies solely with the author, in
which no actor, however skilful, can help
him; on the other hand, a novel depends
chiefly on its human interest, and this the
author must supply himself, since he has no
intermediaries to make good where he fails.
There is little doubt that abstract ideas do
not help the human interest of a novel. It
is remarkable how small a part the abstract
plays in the lives of even the most thoughtful
of us, and anything in the nature of a
problem or an idea, of anything belonging
to the brain rather than to the heart, has a
tendency to destroy the illusion of real life
which it is the chief object of a novelist to
create.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another reason why Galsworthy is more
successful in his plays than in his novels
is that most good plays are founded on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>situation, most good novels on the development
of a situation, and development is not a
characteristic of Galsworthy’s art. He likes
to take a situation, examine it from characteristic
and conflicting points of view, and
show the effect it has on different lives, but
he never attempts to develop it, to start a
chain of events from it, mould characters
by it. Practically every character in a
Galsworthy novel, with the possible exception
of <cite>The Dark Flower</cite>, is the same at the
end as at the beginning. This means that
in his novels he is still a playwright as far
as both situation and character are concerned.
He develops neither, he never goes
forward, he goes round. The result is that
his novels are mostly plays in novel form, and
they suffer in consequence.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fact all the drawbacks of the novels
may be said to arise from defects in the
human interest so essential to a novelist.
It is not that Galsworthy does not feel, and
most passionately, for his characters, neither
is it that they are not flesh and blood, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>that their stories are not real and moving.
It is rather because they are types, not
individuals, and types chosen to fit some
particular situation which has been already
selected. They are never mere pegs or mere
puppets, but somehow there is nothing
creative about them; they lack the individual
touch which the actor can impart to a character
in a play, but which the author alone
can give in a novel. Also they repeat themselves,
there is not enough diversity; the
same groups arrange themselves in different
novels. Of course there are exceptions—Lord
Miltoun in <cite>The Patrician</cite>, Mr Stone in
<cite>Fraternity</cite>—but these, on examination, prove
to be only a fining down of the type till it
is almost an individual; there is no definite
creation.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, against this defect, which is
due to the intrusion of the playwright into
the novelist’s sphere, we must set a wonderful
and seldom-failing craft, which goes far
to justify that intrusion. There are few
novelists with a finer sense of form than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Galsworthy, few with a finer sense of style—the
conciseness of the dramatist teaches
him the need of arrangement and the full
value to be wrung out of a word. In one
point only does the dramatist fail the
novelist, and that, strange to say, is in
dialogue. Again and again the dialogue in
the novels falls flat, or is stilted, or irrelevant—and
it is curious, when we remember how
strong the plays are in this respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a certain inequality about the
seven novels: <cite>The Island Pharisees</cite>, <cite>The Man
of Property</cite>, <cite>The Country House</cite>, <cite>Fraternity</cite>,
<cite>The Patrician</cite>, <cite>The Dark Flower</cite>, and <cite>The
Freelands</cite>. In every way the first is the
weakest, but, on the other hand, the last
is not the most successful. The finest
are <cite>The Man of Property</cite> and <cite>Fraternity</cite>.
Undoubtedly Galsworthy is at his best
when his technique is at its highest pitch
of excellence, and weakest when his sense
of form most fails him. Form is never
used by him to cover defects of interest,
beauty, or reality. <cite>Fraternity</cite>, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>very nearly his masterpiece, almost reaches
technical perfection, while <cite>The Island
Pharisees</cite>—which is as near as he can go
to writing a thoroughly bad novel—is also
the most faultily constructed.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Island Pharisees</cite> shows perhaps more
than any of the novels the raw edges of his
art. He is burning with indignation at the
self-righteousness of the British middle
classes, and his power as a novelist is as yet
too undeveloped to cope with his zeal as a
reformer. He lacks too that subtlety of
warfare which in the plays and later novels
makes his propaganda so effective and at
the same time is one of his truest safeguards
as an artist—the exposure of a cause out
of the mouth of its own champions. He
attacks crudely—through a series of events
which are not always above the suspicion of
pre-arrangement, through dialogue which
is often man&oelig;uvred and artificial. None
of his characters, except Ferrand, the vagabond,
has much of the breath of life, and
over the whole hangs a fog of bitterness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>which is scarcely ever dispelled by those
illuminating phrases and flashes of insight
into his opponents’ cause, which elsewhere
make him so appealing.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is little doubt that if <cite>The Island
Pharisees</cite> were Galsworthy’s average instead
of his low-water mark, his position as a
novelist would be negligible. But his other
novels, without exception, are so superior
in technique, in human interest, in beauty,
and in force, that we cannot consider <cite>The
Island Pharisees</cite> as anything but the first
uncertain step of one who is feeling his way.
In <cite>The Man of Property</cite> we have the same
idea—the satire of a class—but it is brought
before us so differently that comparison is
impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Forsyte family are representatives
of that section of the middle class whose
chief aim is Possession. The Forsytes
possess many things—they possess money,
they possess artistic treasures, houses,
wives, and children, they even possess
talents; but with them the verb “I have” is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of more importance than its object. “This
interests me, not in itself, but because it is
mine”—is their motto. In many ways
they are less heartless, less hypocritical
than the country Pharisees; the consciousness
of possession brings a certain stamina,
a worth and solidarity, which compel admiration.
Also Galsworthy has been far more
tolerant in their portrayal. The Forsytes
are human, they are not like the Dennants;
they are undoubtedly types, even their
differentiations are typical, but they are
types of flesh and blood, not merely of points
of view. There is something in the grouping
of them too which is impressive. These
six old brothers whose god is property have
a certain greatness; though they and their
lust of possession are satirised in many
telling episodes, we feel that nevertheless
the nation would do badly without them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chief representative of Forsytism
belongs, however, to one of the younger
branches of the family. Soames Forsyte
is essentially the Man of Property, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>we see the lust of possession working in him
not only through the splendid house he is
building, but through his wife Irene. It is
in his attitude towards Irene that he declares
himself most definitely the Man of Property.
He is not unkind to her, he is not untrue to
her, but she is his in the sense that the Robin
Hill house is his, and it is this realisation
which fills her with bitterness and loathing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Irene belongs to the contrasting group
which Galsworthy uses in his novels as in
his plays. She and her lover Bosinney
stand for all that is antagonistic to the
Forsytes. In many ways Irene is one of
Galsworthy’s most vivid creations. She is
a type we meet elsewhere in the novels, yet
she has about her certain elements of originality.
Something individual creeps into
the magnetic softness, the passion-haunted
quietness, which are characteristic of so
many Galsworthy women. She is human,
and she is in revolt—but not strenuously or
effectively. Galsworthy has little sympathy
for the strong successful woman, who either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>defeats circumstances or handles them with
capable cunning. In his delineation of
June Forsyte, who belongs to this class, he
is sometimes reluctantly admiring, but never
sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c001'>June Forsyte, with her decided chin and
managing ways, is the antithesis of Irene,
strong only in her softness. It is easy to
understand how this very contrast would
have switched Bosinney’s love from one to
the other, but the change itself is not very
convincingly brought about. Perhaps this
is partly due to the fact that Bosinney
himself is not a success. He is the representative
of the contrast group; property
to him is nothing, he spends his time and
talent—in the end risking his career—on
the house which is Soames Forsyte’s. On
the other hand, it is his sudden knowledge
that another also owns the woman of whom
he had thought himself the sole possessor
that drives him to madness and suicide.
Property makes its appeal even to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is throughout the book a depth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>gloom, as if the shadows of great possessions
lay over it. None of the characters is really
attractive, except, perhaps, old Jolyon
Forsyte; there is something subtly caddish
about them all, and the author’s lack of
sympathy sours the whole. Studied in the
light especially of his novels, it is a strange
error to call Galsworthy “detached.” The
side he takes is always apparent, in spite of
what he says on the other, and his lack of
sympathy with the human representatives
of the opposite point of view is often so great
as to put them out of drawing. Fine as
the Forsytes are, they would have been much
finer if the author had penetrated in some
degree beneath their outer skin, shown
sympathy with the springs of their nature
as well as understanding of their mental
attitude. His sympathies in <cite>The Man of
Property</cite> are undoubtedly with Irene Forsyte
and with Bosinney—though it would seem
that this character sometimes repelled and
baffled even his creator.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole there is something haunting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>about the book—something in the gloom of
its ending which makes us shudder after it
is closed. Property triumphs. Bosinney is
beaten and killed by the Man of Property,
and Irene is brought back to the slavery
from which she revolted.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Huddled in her grey fur against the
sofa-cushions, she had a strange resemblance
to a captive owl, bunched in its soft feathers
against the wires of a cage. The supple
erectness of her figure was gone, as though
she had been broken by cruel exercise; as
though there were no longer any reason
for being beautiful, and supple, and erect.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Thus the curtain rings down on Irene
Forsyte, crushed under the heel of
prosperity, robbed of her love by a sudden
awakening of the sense of property in the
heart of the man she had thought clean
of it....</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Country House</cite> also deals with a class,
and it is the country equivalent of the
Forsytes. The Pendyces are big country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>proprietors, but the property is to them a
good deal more than material possession.
It is their Position in the county that they
think of, their Standing; Dignity is with
them almost as important as Land, and more
important than Money. Also they are not
quite so much a type as the Forsytes—in
certain broad characteristics they may be
found in dozens of country manors, but in
others they are unique. They do everything
with the greatest amount of unnecessary
trouble to themselves and other people.
“Pendyce,” says Paramor to Vigil, when
discussing the threatened divorce, “he’d
give his eyes for the case not to come on,
but you’ll see he’ll rub everything up the
wrong way, and it’ll be a miracle if we
succeed. That’s ’Pendycitis’!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Even George, who in some ways breaks
free from the family tradition, is afflicted
by it. It is largely owing to Pendycitis
that he loses Helen Bellew. He tires her
with that dogged quality of his, which spares
neither himself nor her, but sends him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>plodding and muddling on in the face of
impossible circumstances. He cannot yield,
and he is not really strong—he is a Pendyce;
and it is with luxurious relief that she finds
herself free of him at last.</p>

<p class='c001'>Helen Bellew is only lightly sketched
in, her presence is almost always merely
physical. She has many of the outward
essentials of the Galsworthy heroine, that
particular dower of ripe, seductive, yet
delicate, beauty which we find in Irene
Forsyte, Audrey Noel, and Olive Cramier.
But she is heartless—which those others are
not—and hence we seem to find a certain
reluctance on the author’s part to probe into
her. What is heartless cannot be truly
beautiful, according to his creed, and he
wants us to realise how beautiful Helen
Bellew was, so that she became a force, a
moulding-stamp, to the hard, unimpressionable
George Pendyce.</p>

<p class='c001'>The real heroine of <cite>The Country House</cite> is
George’s mother, Margery Pendyce, and she
is, practically without exception, the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>charming character in Galsworthy’s novels.
She is the Mother—not the Mother in her
elemental form, but the Mother as civilisation
and education and pain have made
her; not very different from the primitive
type, perhaps, but dainty with a score of
sweet refinements. Quieted by her long
subjection in the school of Pendyce, she yet
has the invincible courage of gentleness;
accustomed for years to yield where her own
comfort and happiness only are concerned,
she takes an impregnable stand at last when
her children’s welfare is at stake. There is
something heroic in this gentle, soft-gowned,
lavender-scented figure, moving so peacefully
among her roses, caring so dutifully for
her household and her husband, and then
suddenly putting them all from her, to take
her place beside her outcast son.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“I have gone up to London to be with
George” (she writes simply to Pendyce),
“you will remember what I said last night.
Perhaps you did not quite realise that I
meant it. Take care of poor old Roy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>don’t let them give him too much meat this
hot weather. Jackman knows better than
Ellis how to manage the roses. Please do
not worry about me. Good-bye, dear
Horace; I am sorry if I grieve you.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Margery Pendyce is the chief of the contrast
group in this novel; with her is
Gregory Vigil, the idealist, who looks at the
sky when it would be better if he looked at
the street and saw where he was going.
Unselfishness, quietness, and idealism are
the contrasts of Pendycitis. The Reverend
Hussell Barter, who is a kind of clerical
Pendyce, is one of Galsworthy’s most successful
attempts at humour. He is drawn with
many a memorable satiric flick, and doubtless
this is a reason why he succeeds, for
Galsworthy’s humour without irony is apt
to be trivial.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another striking character is the Spaniel
John—here Galsworthy has succeeded in
giving a dog a very definite personality.
John is not only a dog, he is a spaniel—the
distinct psychology of the spaniel works in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>him, and we could never think of him as a
terrier or a collie. Indeed the author has
taken as much trouble over the Spaniel
John as over any character in the book, and
been as successful.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>THE NOVELS <br /> II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One can say without much fear of
contradiction that after <cite>The Man
of Property</cite> the finest of Galsworthy’s
novels is <cite>Fraternity</cite>. Indeed it
comes as near being a perfect work of
art as any novel ever written. There
have been many novels with a stronger
appeal, a wider comprehension, a greater
depth and force, but few of which it can
be said that they fulfil more completely the
canons of novel-writing. And this is to be
understood not only of the letter but of the
spirit—<cite>Fraternity</cite> is no mere triumph of
technique, it is a moving, human and beautiful
story, about people who are real, if
drawn in pale colours, and situations which
are Life, in spite of their elusiveness.</p>

<p class='c001'>In its perfection of balance, <cite>Fraternity</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>reminds one of the plays. There is a central
situation, flanked by two contrasting groups.
It is not of mere industrial or moral significance,
nor is it the satirisation of any
particular class; it is a problem which has
always occupied human minds, and will do
so till the end of time—the problem of the
rich and the poor. It is embodied in old
Mr Stone, with his great unfinished—and,
we suspect, ever to be unfinished—work on
Brotherhood. “Each one of us has a shadow
in those places—in those streets.” Mr
Stone is one of Galsworthy’s finest achievements.
In him the author shows what few
have even attempted to show, the infinite
pathos of moral greatness. There is no
denying the greatness of Mr Stone, in spite
of his mental kink, and his pathos is as
evident. He is alone, it is his own doing;
he cannot, if he would, bind himself up with
others. He writes of Fraternity, but in
life he never touches a brother’s hand—he
does nothing to unite those two brothers
whose embrace he writes of, and his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>life is equally remote from either. They
come near him, they put out tentative,
appealing hands—and with a wistful sigh
he turns to his book.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classes are represented by the two
Dallison families, the Masses by the Hughes,
Creed, and the little model. It is remarkable
how tightly the whole fabric is drawn
together—Hilary and Stephen Dallison have
married two sisters, Bianca and Cecilia, and
their Shadows live together under the same
roof. We know what would be, with an
average novelist, the result of such an effort
at concentration, but nothing could be
more natural, more inevitable, than the
knitting up of these groups.</p>

<p class='c001'>The little model is not a common Galsworthy
type; in fact, she stands almost
alone in his novels. Quiet and soft she undoubtedly
is, like most of his women, but
the meek vulgarity of her little mind is something
new. She is drawn with a wonderful
sympathy, as indeed are all the characters
in the book; for in <cite>Fraternity</cite>, Galsworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>does not seem to have been so much struck
by the irony of his theme as by its pathos.
There is one beautiful account of her, leaving
Hilary’s house, which sheds a tender
light like a spring sunset over her figure,
making it at once terribly pathetic and
terribly young.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“She kept turning her face back as she
went down the path, as though to show her
gratitude. And presently, looking up from
his manuscript, he saw her face still at
the railings, peering through a lilac bush.
Suddenly she skipped, like a child let out
of school. Hilary got up, perturbed. The
sight of that skipping was like the rays of a
lantern turned on the dark street of another
human being’s life. It revealed, as in a
flash, the loneliness of this child, without
money and without friends, in the midst of
this great town.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The Hughes group is in its units to be
found in many of Galsworthy’s works: the
bullying husband, gross, selfish, an animal—but
an animal broken—the meek wife who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>complains and nags, but has at the bottom
of her heart an unreasoning dog-like quality
which will let her make no effective efforts
for freedom; the poor old man, fallen on
evil days, yet with a philosophy, and a self-respect
which is almost pride. Galsworthy
never sees the poor and outcast in an aureole
of false idealism. If he sadly confesses that
the classes do not know how to help the
masses, he also confesses that the masses
do not know how to help themselves. If
the Dallisons are timid and inefficient,
Hughes is an undeserving brute, and Mrs
Hughes a scold who is largely responsible
for her own ills. The little model is forlorn,
but she is also designing. The result is that
an atmosphere of deep depression hangs over
<cite>Fraternity</cite>. One might say that its moral
was “For rich is rich and poor is poor, and
never the twain shall meet”—except in the
unfinished book of a cranky idealist.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Like flies caught among the impalpable
and smoky threads of cobwebs, so men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>struggle in the webs of their own natures,
giving here a start, there a pitiful small
jerking, long sustained, and falling into
stillness. Enmeshed they were born, enmeshed
they die, fighting according to their
strength to the end; to fight in the hope of
freedom, their joy; to die, not knowing
they are beaten, their reward.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Patrician</cite> is scarcely equal to <cite>Fraternity</cite>.
In it the bitterness, which seemed to
have slumbered for a while, awakes, and
helps to distort the picture. Also in no
novel, I think, is more obvious Galsworthy’s
lack of sympathy with certain of his characters.
The book suffers in having for its
central figure a man whom the author admires
but does not really understand. Lord
Miltoun is a noble conception, but Galsworthy
does not get to the bottom of his struggle.
One feels all the way through that he admires
him, but cannot sympathise with him,
and the result is that the real grounds of
Miltoun’s actions are seldom displayed.
We never penetrate beneath the surface of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>this character, whose inner mind we nevertheless
would know rather than many
whose workings are shown us.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is also a group, the Valleys group,
whom Galsworthy is passionately wanting
to treat fairly, but for whom he cannot conceal
a bitterness not unflavoured with contempt.
Lord Valleys, his wife, his sons, his
daughters, are drawn with a painstaking
effort to hide his real feeling towards them,
but the effort often breaks down; even
Barbara, splendid and brave, has a repelling
hardness in which stick one or two ironic
arrows of her creator. Courtier, who represents
the Other Point of View, is sometimes
rather vaguely drawn, and suffers
in the opposite way to Miltoun, for Galsworthy,
while apparently sympathising with
his attitude, does not seem to have the same
admiration for his character.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only person in the book who is both
admired and understood is Mrs Noel. Here
we have a very appealing figure, tragic yet
quiet, courageous yet soft, made for love,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>vibrant with passion, full of an infinite
delicacy and self-respect. Self-respect is
an unfailing characteristic of Galsworthy’s
good women; he has no sympathy with the
woman who in times of stress loses her
personal dignity, and forgets all those little
trivial refinements of body which are part
of her greatness. Audrey Noel “incorrigibly
loved to look as charming as she could;
and even if no one were going to see her, she
never felt that she looked charming enough.”
He realises that for a woman who respects
herself it is not enough to be merely clean
and tidy, she must be as beautiful as circumstances
will allow—it is not vanity but her
dignity which demands it. Mrs Noel appeals
because her courage is so infinite, and
because it is so essentially a woman’s courage,
a thing of gentleness and soft endurance,
not of the stiff but of the smiling lip.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a certain unsatisfactoriness in
the tragedy of her relations with Miltoun.
He falls from his ideal, but only half-way,
so to speak—the rest of his difficulty is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>solved by her abnegation. One is given
the impression, in spite of much talking
between the characters, that the vital heart
of the matter has never been reached. “If
the lark’s song means nothing—if that sky
is a morass of our invention—if we are
pettily creeping on, furthering nothing—persuade
me of it, and I’ll bless you.” That
desperate cry of Miltoun seems to give
more of the essence of his struggle than any
arguments about Religion and Authority.
One feels that both were only names on
lips—it was not merely a respect for
authority that made Miltoun first deny himself
Audrey, and then when he had taken
her, believe himself bound to throw aside
his public life. The appeal of Authority is
not made convincing enough, the appeal to
Religion not spiritual enough, for a man of
Miltoun’s type—one sees him acting, generally
at least, according to the dead letter
of both; one knows there must have been
a quickening spirit behind to drive such a
man, but one is not shown it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span><cite>The Dark Flower</cite> is in some ways a
departure from his usual methods. It
lacks the central problem, with its balanced
and contrasted groups. It is not a study
of a situation nor of a class; it is a study
of passion. There has always been plenty of
passion in Galsworthy’s books; he is not
a cold writer, and though his central idea
is often social or intellectual, in his treatment
of it he never loses sight of the fact
that human emotions are stronger than
human intellects, and play a more important
part in all situations, no matter
how purely technical and general these may
appear. But in <cite>The Dark Flower</cite>, passion is
not an incident or a moulding force, it is
the central theme. We are shown its growth
in three different stages—its first kindling
in the heart of a boy, its consummation in
the young man and woman, its last flicker
in the man who sees old age approaching
and to whom youth calls.</p>

<p class='c001'>To carry out his idea Galsworthy is forced
to put aside much of that compactness which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>is so effective in his other novels. Indeed
<cite>The Dark Flower</cite> is really three separate
stories, of which the hero, Mark Lennan, is
the connecting link. A really fine character
might have held these three episodes together,
but Lennan is vaguely drawn. He
is most convincing as boy and middle-aged
man; in the central part he is swamped in
the vehemence of his own love. Indeed
the passion of Lennan and Olive Cramier
is far the greatest thing about them—taken
apart from it they are both a little colourless.
Olive is much less life-like than Audrey Noel,
Irene Forsyte, and others of her kind; she
is vague and shadowy beside the heroines of
the two other episodes, Anne Stormer and
Nell Dromore.</p>

<p class='c001'>These women are in many ways the
best-drawn characters in the book. Anne
Stormer, caught on the fringe of middle age
by the gust of her passion for a boy of
eighteen, swept by it, rocked by it, but conscious
all the time of its hopelessness with
regard to herself, its cruelty with regard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>him, in the end gives him up to the little
girl of his own age, with whom he climbs
trees, and in whose presence he forgets the
dark flower whose scent in her bosom had
given him his first staggering draught of life.
She is a character fine through her pathos,
through the inevitableness of her renunciation,
which is not made from any high
spirit of courage or self-sacrifice, but simply
because she must.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very different is Nell Dromore, who sends
the mocking cry of youth after Lennan when,
having passed through the storm of his love
for Olive Cramier, and married his boyhood’s
playfellow, Sylvia Doone, he sees old age
creeping towards him, passionless and adventureless.
She is an extraordinary study
of mingled abandonment and innocence.
She leads him on by methods which would
not disgrace a courtesan if they had not
about them all the delicious shamelessness
of a child. In the end he has the strength
to wrench himself from her, knowing that
she brings him but a false hope, for which his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>wife’s broken heart must pay. Sylvia,
though winning and sweet in the first episode,
is rather shadowy here, where she has such
an important part. No doubt her ineffectiveness
is to a certain extent deliberate,
but for all that it should not be unreal, or
we lose sight of it as a force in Lennan’s
struggle.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole it must be said that Galsworthy
is at his best when most characteristic,
and here, where he turns to the methods
of the more ordinary novelist, he loses some
of his strength. There are, however, some
impressive scenes in the book, and he has
again shown his peculiar successfulness in
dealing with youth and young love. There
are delightful pictures of the boy Mark, in
which his growing, half-understood infatuation
is never allowed to drown the frankness
of his youth; and the scenes between him
and Sylvia remind us of similar scenes in <cite>Joy</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In <cite>The Freelands</cite>, Galsworthy reverts
to the more characteristic mood; indeed
the book is reminiscent—in a stimulating,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>legitimate way. Its structure reminds one
of <cite>The Man of Property</cite>, and its environment
of <cite>The Country House</cite>. As in the first of
these the web was spun over the framework
of the six brothers Forsyte, so here we have
the four brothers Freeland to serve as pegs—and
they live in circumstances that recall
the Pendyces and their problems. Not that
they are all four country people—Felix is a
successful author and lives at Hampstead,
and John is in the Home Office; but the
family meets at Becket, where Stanley who
has made a fortune by exporting ploughs,
has an estate, and Tod, the eccentric and
revolutionary, lives the simple life, freehold.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then there is the old mother, one of those
tender, sturdy, odd patricians whom the
author can draw so clearly, and there is the
young <a id='corr82.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='genereration'>generation</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_82.19'><ins class='correction' title='genereration'>generation</ins></a></span> as represented by Nedda,
Felix’s inquiring daughter, and Tod’s
anarchistic Derek and Sheila—also the
wives of three Freelands, especially Tod’s
Kirsteen.</p>

<p class='c001'>These characters are not considered so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>much in relation to each other as in relation
to the central problem, which is The Land—and
The Land with Galsworthy is, of course,
not the good earth but the slaves that toil
on it. He studies the labouring man in
connection with his employers, the petty
tyrannies of Manor, Parsonage, and Farm.
Bob Tryst is evicted because his marriage
with his deceased wife’s sister displeases the
Squiress, Lady Malloring, and the poor
Gaunts are hounded from pillar to post
because the daughter has “got into trouble.”
Galsworthy pillories Feudalism, which he
sees rampant over English rusticity, and
parts of <cite>The Freelands</cite> read like a Gladstone
League pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, to any one who loathes “the
People,” whether of fields or streets, the central
interest of <cite>The Freelands</cite> is Galsworthy’s
study of a modern English family. He is
rather fond of this especial study—we have
it in <cite>The Man of Property</cite>, <cite>The Country
House</cite>, and <cite>The Patrician</cite>; we see it hovering
near <cite>Fraternity</cite>. The combinations and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>permutations of blood relationship seem to
interest him enormously—the modern push
and individualism, half attacking, half combining
with old-fashioned ideas of kinship
and unity. He shows how the family Idea
survives, in spite of actual disruptions, and
can outlive even an utter lack of common
life, interest, or sympathy—so that the unloved
brother must come somehow before
the loved stranger, simply because he is
One of the Family. It is probably a lurking
of the primitive clan instinct, and one would
like to see it treated of even more thoroughly
than Galsworthy has done. It is interesting
to watch him with these Freelands, linked
by their family tie, and also, in this case, by
the wise, kindly, foolish old mother of them
all—who is, however, Tod’s in particular.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other matters <cite>The Freelands</cite> makes its
predecessor, <cite>The Dark Flower</cite>, stand out
even more as an exception or parenthesis.
In his latest novel we have all his early,
usual traits: all his old defects of too
general a characterisation, too careful a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>balance, too deliberate a sacrifice of the
artist to the moralist, but at the same time
the virtues of these defects—restraint, craft,
and purpose, and, besides, those intrinsic
qualities which are the real building-stuff
of his work.</p>

<p class='c001'>The characters of these four brothers,
their wives and children and associates, are
drawn with a firm touch lightened by much
satire of the kinder sort. There is that sense
and grasp of beauty which we find so inevitably
in Galsworthy’s treatment of even
the stuffiest theme. We have, too, a sense
of aloofness which, if it is sometimes irritating,
is occasionally majestic, and lit by
warm, sudden flashes of penetration into
characters one would have thought, by other
signs, to be beyond his sphere of understanding.
The book may not be so good as
<cite>Fraternity</cite>, it is certainly not so great as
<cite>The Man of Property</cite>, but it is, nevertheless,
among the best he has given us, which is
encouraging, since it is, though only temporarily,
one hopes, the last.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>THE SKETCHES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><cite>Villa Rubein</cite> and four short
stories under the title of <cite>A Man
of Devon</cite> were published anonymously.
All early efforts, they are not on a
line with Galsworthy’s later work, but they
have about them a certain beauty and individuality
which makes them worth considering.
Perhaps their chief characteristic
is delicacy: they are water-colours, in many
ways exquisitely conceived and shaded, but
perhaps a trifle pale and washed out, a trifle—it
must be owned—uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>Villa Rubein</cite>, describing with much sensitive
charm the life of a half-Austrian household,
is full of tenderness, but lacking somehow
in grip. The characters are more
attractive than most of Galsworthy’s—in
fact, in no work of his do we meet such a
uniformly charming group of people. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>are sketched, even the less pleasing, with an
entire absence of bitterness, and the heroine,
Christian, and her little half-German sister
are delightful in their freshness and grave
sweetness. Miss Naylor and old Nic Treffry
are also drawn with a loving and convincing
hand. The book seems to have been written
in a mellow mood which passed with it.
Yet we pay for any absence of bitterness,
propaganda or pessimism, by a corresponding
lack of force. It must be confessed that
Galsworthy is most effective when he is
most gloomy, most penetrating when he
is most bitter, most humorous when he
is most satirical.</p>

<p class='c001'>The short stories call for no special comment
except <cite>The Salvation of a Forsyte</cite>, where
we meet for the first time Swithin Forsyte,
later to figure in <cite>The Man of Property</cite>. We
are introduced to an early adventure of his,
which is treated with some technical skill
and an impressive irony. The tale has
grip, and is not far off French excellence
of craft. The other stories are too long for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>their themes, which, if not actually thin in
themselves, are dragged out in the telling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of very different stuff are the four
volumes of sketches—<cite>A Commentary</cite>, <cite>A
Motley</cite>, <cite>The Inn of Tranquillity</cite>, and <cite>The
Little Man</cite>. In these, except, perhaps, in
the last, we have some of Galsworthy’s best
work, much of it equal, in its different way,
to the finest of the plays and novels.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>A Commentary</cite> deals chiefly with the life
of the very poor, showing the intimacy of
the author’s knowledge, and the depths of
his sympathy. Some of the sketches are
indictments of the social order which favours
those who have money and tramples those
who have none. <cite>Justice</cite>, for instance, is a
fresh exposure of the oft-exposed inequality
of the divorce laws where rich and poor are
concerned. <cite>A Mother</cite> is a piteous revelation
of those depths of horror and humiliation
which form the daily life of many. Continually,
in the plays and in the novels,
Galsworthy reveals the utter brutishness of
some of these submerged ones. He never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>attempts to enforce his social ethics by
glorification of those he champions. Such
men as Hughes, in <cite>Fraternity</cite>, or the husband,
in <cite>A Mother</cite>, are absolutely of the lowest stuff
and, it would seem, unworthy of a hand to
help them out of the mud in which they roll.
But here lies the subtlety of the reproach—it
is the social system with its cruelties and
stupidities which is responsible for this.
There is something more forceful than all
the sufferings of the deserving in this grim
picture of utter degradation, the depths of
bestialism into which mismanaged civilisation
can grind divine souls.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other of the sketches we are shown the
opposite side of the picture—the selfishness
of the prosperous, their lack of ideals and
imagination. Now Galsworthy becomes
bitter; with a steely hardness he describes
the comfortable life of the upper middle
classes, of the fashionable and wealthy.
The bias of <cite>A Commentary</cite> is obvious
throughout, and throughout propaganda
takes the first place. The fragments are held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>together by the central idea, which is the
exposure—ironic, indignant, embittered, infinitely
pitying—of the inequalities between
the poor and the rich. True, there is atmosphere,
style, a sense of character; but in
<cite>A Commentary</cite> the artist takes second place.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>A Motley</cite> is, as the title implies, a collection
linked up by no central view-point.
Character sketches, episodes of the streets
and of the fields, reflections on life, art,
manners, anything, and all widely different
in style and length, crowd together between
the covers, without any definite scheme.
They show extraordinary powers of observation
and intuition, and at the same time a
certain lack of grip, which is always the first
of Galsworthy’s weaknesses to come to light
in a failing situation. Some of the sketches
are too slight, over-fined. On the other
hand, some have true poetry and true pathos
in their conception. The style is more
polished, the pleading less special, the knowledge
less embittered than in <cite>A Commentary</cite>.
Particularly successful is <cite>A Fisher of Men</cite>, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>which Galsworthy is at his best, giving us a
sympathetic and tragic picture of a type
with which we know he has little sympathy—there
is no bitterness here, just pathos.
<cite>Once More</cite> is a study of lower-class life
slightly recalling <cite>A Mother</cite>, but here again
is far more tenderness, due partly, no doubt,
to the wistfulness of youth that creeps into
the story. Then there are sketches of life
and the furtive love of the London parks;
no one has realised more poignantly than
Galsworthy all the tragedy of hidden meetings
and hidden partings with which our
public places are filled.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>The Inn of Tranquillity</cite> is also a mixed
collection, and in it we see far more of Galsworthy
the poet and the artist than of
Galsworthy the social reformer. There are
in the book fragments of sheer beauty which
would be hard to beat anywhere in modern
prose. Take, for instance, the painting of
dawn in <cite>Wind in the Rocks</cite>:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“That god came slowly, stalking across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>far over our heads from top to top; then,
of a sudden, his flame-white form was seen
standing in a gap of the valley walls; the
trees flung themselves along the ground
before him, and censers of pine gum began
swinging in the dark aisles, releasing their
perfumed steam. Throughout these happy
ravines where no man lives, he shows himself
naked and unashamed, the colour of pale
honey; on his golden hair such shining as
one has not elsewhere seen; his eyes like
old wine on fire. And already he had swept
his hand across the invisible strings, for there
had arisen the music of uncurling leaves and
flitting things.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Take also just this sentence from <cite>A
Novelist’s Allegory</cite>: “those pallid gleams
... remain suspended like a handful of
daffodils held up against the black stuffs of
secrecy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Galsworthy allows himself to play with
words, blend them, contrast them, savour
their sweet sound and the roll and suck
of them under the tongue ... he becomes
a poet in prose. But it is not only words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>that make his poetry. He seizes aspects of
beauty and gives them to us palpitating,
fresh from their capture, a poet’s prey. Such
is <cite>Riding in Mist</cite>, a consummate study of the
misty moor, damp, sweet, and dangerous.
There is, too, a wonderful sense of locality
in <cite>That Old-Time Place</cite>—it throbs with
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we have many studies besides of words
and place. There is <cite>Memories</cite>, in which
Galsworthy uses his real understanding of
dog-nature, faithful and true. There is <cite>The
Grand Jury</cite>, in which he shows the fullness
of his sympathy for the human dog, the
bottom dog, so generally and necessarily
ignored by laws which are inevitably made
for the upper layer of humanity. We have,
too, some illuminating comments on the
world of letters. In <cite>About Censorship</cite> there
is fine irony, and in <cite>Some Platitudes Concerning
the Drama</cite> plenty of illumination. Indeed,
in this article we are given a plain
enough statement of the rules which evidently
govern Galsworthy’s own work. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>instance: “A good plot is that sure edifice
which slowly rises out of the interplay of
circumstance on temperament and temperament
on circumstance, within the enclosing
atmosphere of an idea.” There could be no
clearer definition of the plan governing
<cite>Strife</cite> and <cite>The Silver Box</cite>. The pronouncement
on dramatic dialogue, too, applies
admirably to much of Galsworthy’s own
achievement:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“The art of writing true dramatic
dialogue is an austere art, denying itself
all license, grudging every sentence devoted
to the mere machinery of the play, suppressing
all jokes and epigrams severed from
character, relying for fun and pathos on
the fun and tears of life. From start to
finish good dialogue is hand-made, like good
lace; clear, of fine texture, furthering with
each thread the harmony and strength of a
design to which all must be subordinated.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In his last book of sketches—<cite>The Little
Man and other Satires</cite>—Galsworthy has made
a deliberate sacrifice of beauty. He has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>left the luminous Italian backgrounds of
<cite>The Inn of Tranquillity</cite>, the rustling English
twilights of <cite>A Motley</cite>, for the midnight lamp
on his study table. This is why, perhaps,
<cite>The Little Man</cite> depresses me. Galsworthy
has not stood the test—he has grown bitter.
His satire is more akin to that of Swift
than Samuel Butler, but without Swift’s
redeeming largeness, his tumbling restlessness.
Galsworthy’s bitterness is the well-bred
bitterness of the pessimist at afternoon
tea; Swift is the pessimist in the tavern,
raging round and breaking pots.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, an author’s point of view is not
a fair subject for criticism, any more than
the shape of his head; he probably cannot
help it. But it may be deplored.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most striking thing about the book
itself is the subdivision titled <cite>Studies in
Extravagance</cite>. Here we have some remorseless,
if only partial, truth—the fierce
glow of the searchlight, more concentrated
though more limited than the wide shining
of the sun. We have <cite>The Writer</cite>, <cite>The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Housewife</cite>, <em>The Plain Man</em>, etc., all pierced
through to their most startling worst.
Galsworthy will make no concessions—he
will not show us a single motherly redeeming
virtue in that woman of schemes and covert
horribleness whom he presents as a possible
variety of British matron. So too with his
Writer—those flickers of amiable naivety
which occasionally humanise the writers
most of us know are shut out from this
portrait of an ape playing with the ABC.
It is clever, fierce, vindictive, and partly true.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are some gentler sketches in the
book—for instance, the name-piece, in which
we have a really witty and typical picture
of an American, with his God’s own gift
of admiring good deeds he will not do himself.
There is also <em>Abracadabra</em>, in which
the satire is fundamentally tender, and with
little significant bitterness—though in time
one comes to resent Galsworthy’s inalienable
idea that every woman is ill-used in marriage.
There is also such genuine wit, terseness,
and point in <em>Hall Marked</em> that one can afford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>to skip the humours of the parson’s trousers.
<em>Ultima Thule</em> is more in <em>The Motley</em> and
<em>Commentary</em> vein. We are glad to meet the
old man who could tame cats and bullfinches.
But why sigh over him so much? He was
happy and to be envied, even though he
lived in a back room on a few farthings.
This misplaced pity is becoming irritating
in Galsworthy. His earlier works—<em>Strife</em>,
<em>The Man of Property</em>—are innocent of it,
but lately it has grown to be a habit with
him. He cannot resist the temptation to
weep over everyone whose clothes are not
quite as good as his own.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is scarcely surprising that a writer with
Galsworthy’s sense of words and atmosphere
should have written a book of verse—the
only surprise is that his solitary experiment
in poetry should not have been more successful.
When we remember the exquisite prose
of his plays, novels and sketches, the admirable
description, the sense of atmosphere,
not forgetting also the genuine poetry of
much of <em>The Little Dream</em>, we are surprised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>not to find in <em>Moods, Songs and Doggerels</em>,
anything of permanent quality, or worthy
to stand beside his other work. There are
some delightful songs of the country, of
Devon, one or two little fragrant snatches,
like puffs of breeze. But the more ambitious
pieces, the <em>Moods</em>, are for the most part
wanting in inspiration. They are just prose,
and not nearly such fine prose as we have a
right to expect from Galsworthy. One or
two stand out as poetry, and these are
mostly studies in atmosphere, such as
<em>Street Lamps</em>:</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>GALSWORTHY THE ARTIST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Galsworthy is an artist before he
is a social reformer. It is a mistake
to consider him chiefly from the
second point of view; for he is not so much
a thinker spreading his propaganda by
artistic methods as an artist whose excellence
is grounded in ideas. <em>Strife</em>, for instance,
was not written to expose the evils
of our present industrial system so much as
from the impulse to create, grounding itself
in an economic problem—which the artist
displays and analyses, just as others, and he
at other times, would display and analyse
any problem of love, manners, life, or human
nature, in the name of “plot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For this reason his propaganda interferes
very little with his art. Moreover, it is a
general propaganda, which lends itself more
directly to artistic purposes than a particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>one. It would be far more difficult, for
instance, to write a human and artistic novel
on the evils of leaded glaze than it would be
to write one on the selfish stupidity of which
leaded glaze is the result. Galsworthy does
not attack, at least in force, any definite
abuses, he attacks those cruel and stupid
powers which are at the bottom of them all—the
love of property for property’s sake, the
false respectability of the unassailed, the
lack of comprehension of one class for another,
Pharisaism, materialism, selfishness,
and cowardice. He is the champion of the
bottom dog, whether human or animal. He
pleads passionately for sympathy with the
abused and downtrodden and outcast. His
throbbing pity vitalises his propaganda, so
that it not only ceases to constrict his art,
but positively enriches it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When he is at his best we find a perfect
blending of art and idea. The second is
bound up in the first, an essential part of it.
As he himself says in <em>Some Platitudes concerning
Drama</em>: “A drama must be shaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>so as to have a spire of meaning. Every
grouping of life and character has its inherent
moral; and the business of the dramatist
is so to pose the group as to bring that
moral poignantly to the light of day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This ideal is completely fulfilled in <em>Strife</em>
and <em>The Silver Box</em>, also in <em>Fraternity</em>, <em>The
Man of Property</em>, and some of the sketches—hence
it is in these that we must look for
his best work. Now and then the idea
carries away the artist, warping his vision,
and we have instances of special pleading,
such as <em>Justice</em>, <em>The Fugitive</em>, and <em>The Island
Pharisees</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a sense Galsworthy’s propaganda is a
part of his technical equipment. He uses it
chiefly in laying his bases; the solidity and
centralisation of his work is due largely to
the economic and social ideas on which he
rears the structure of human passion and
frailty. He does not make Shaw’s mistake
of using dialogue, rather than situation, as
a means of propaganda, neither does he rely
much on character. His moral is inherent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>his situations, and he fails only when he lets
it stray from the basic idea into the super-structure
of character and dialogue.</p>

<p class='c001'>As an artist pure and simple his chief
assets are a sense of situation, a sense of
atmosphere, and the power of presenting
both beautifully. His sense of character
is not particularly wide or profound. He
deals with types rather than individuals,
and the same types repeat themselves a trifle
monotonously. Though he has great gifts
of intuition, and occasional penetrating
flashes, he does not work much below the
surface. It is astonishing, when one considers
the force and passion of so much of
his work, to realise that it is all got from
surface-workings—not that he ever suggests
the shallow or superficial, it is simply a
reluctance to dig.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take, for example, Miltoun, in <em>The Patrician</em>;
here he has attempted to draw a
character whose actions spring from the inmost
recesses of his being, and the result is
a certain unconvincingness marring a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>achievement, for Galsworthy can penetrate
only in swift spasms of intuition, and the
delineation of a character like Miltoun’s
requires no spasmodic descent, but a perpetual
working in the buried and profound.
Galsworthy is a psychological analyst of
some skill; he is sensitive to psychological
variations, but he catches these only in their
exterior manifestations, and the result is
not so much a lack of profundity as a lack
of grip. For this reason his characters,
charming as they sometimes are, interesting
as they always are, never succeed in being
absolutely Life—we never come to know
them really intimately, they are more acquaintances
than friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>This surface-working in character is liable
to impair situation, since the two are interdependent.
Galsworthy is a master of situation,
but occasionally, when the depths ought
to be sounded, we are put off with a consummate
skill of arrangement, a perfection
of combination and interplay. This is so
splendidly done that it is generally not till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>afterwards that we realise the lack, and this
only because Galsworthy’s work so often
leaves an after-taste of aloofness, that, as
every lover of Galsworthy knows he is not
aloof, one sees that something must be wrong
with the art which gives such an impression.</p>

<p class='c001'>Critics speak of Galsworthy’s detachment,
but the true lover knows this is not so. The
sense of aloofness is due partly to his scrupulous
fairness in examining every point of
view, partly to an exaggerated restraint, and
a shrinking from analyses which are not
purely intellectual. One often wishes that
he would give himself rein. It is not
from lack of power that he holds himself in,
it seems to be rather from a certain shyness,
a fastidious shrinking from troubling the
depths or breaking the gates. On the rare
occasions he gives himself freedom, we are
struck by the force and vitality of it all.
Strange as it may seem in one who has been
so often accused of coldness, he is masterly
in conveying the charged atmosphere of
passion. It is true that he writes with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>restraint, with almost too much restraint,
but he has a wonderful power of suggesting
the heavy sweetness of passion, its joys,
its languors, its delicacies rather than its
ferocities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take, for example, the scene in <em>The Man of
Property</em>, when Irene returns to her husband,
after having for the first time met Bosinney
as a lover:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“He hardly recognised her. She seemed
on fire, so deep and rich the colour of her
cheeks, her eyes, her lips, and of the unusual
blouse she wore. She was breathing fast
and deep, as though she had been running,
and with every breath perfume seemed to
come from her hair, and from her body, like
perfume from an opening flower.... He
lifted his finger towards her breast, but she
dashed his hand aside. ‘Don’t touch me!’
she cried. He caught her wrist; she
wrenched it away. ‘And where have you
been?’ he asked. ‘In heaven—out of this
house!’ With those words she fled upstairs....
And Soames stood motionless. What
prevented him from following her? Was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>it that, with the eyes of faith, he saw
Bosinney looking down from that high
window in Sloane Street, straining his eyes
for yet another glimpse of Irene’s vanished
figure, cooling his flushed face, dreaming of
the moment when she flung herself on his
breast—the scent of her still in the air around
and the sound of her laugh that was like a
sob?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Next to a sense of situation Galsworthy
must be granted a sense of atmosphere.
This is due to the extraordinary sensitiveness
he brings into his work, as distinct from
penetration.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Strong sunlight was falling on that
little London garden, disclosing its native
shadowiness; streaks and smudges such as
Life smears over the faces of those who
live too consciously. The late perfume of
the lilac came stealing forth into the air
faintly smeethed with chimney-smoke.
There was brightness but no glory, in that
little garden; scent, but no strong air blown
across golden lakes of buttercups, from seas
of springing clover, or the wind-silver of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>young wheat; music, but no full choir of
sound, no hum.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This passage from <em>Fraternity</em> shows Galsworthy’s
peculiar grasp of subtleties, those
pseudo-expressions of emotion in Nature,
which only the sensitive can find in their
less obvious aspects. For the more obvious
aspects, he has not so much attention. He
deals little with storms and furies, with
nature as a power. Nature to him is rather
an influence, a thing of crafty workings;
and he loves above all others hours of pale
sunlight, faint dawn, or, more still, twilight
languid and hushed, full of troubled
perfumes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“All things waited. The creatures of
night were slow to come forth after that
long bright summer’s day, watching for the
shades of the trees to sink deeper and deeper
into the now chalk-white water; watching
for the chalk-white face of the sky to be
masked with velvet. The very black plumed
trees themselves seemed to wait in suspense
for the grape-bloom of night. All things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>stared, wan in that hour of passing day—all
things had eyes wistful and unblessed.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the matter of style, Galsworthy is not
a purist. One finds a split infinitive spoiling
a procession of beautiful words, and one
occasionally loses patience over a squad of
panting verbless sentences all beginning with
“And.” But he has a gift worth more than
grammatical perfection, and that is a real
sense of words. In their combinations, contrasts,
and values, he marshals them with
a poet’s strategy. He loves those words
which hold their meanings as soldiers
their weapons; one sees him apportioning
the place of honour in a sentence, ranking
the subordinates. He is so absolute a craftsman
that we see in his occasional lapses more
of a deliberate disregard than ignorance, and
certainly nothing of the slipshod.</p>

<p class='c001'>His dialogue in the plays is masterly—not
always so effective in the novels. He is at
his best in the dialogue of the lower classes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Sometimes, even in the plays, the conversation
of his “gentlefolk” is apt to be stilted
or to drag. On the other hand, the speech
of the poor is always both spontaneous and
significant. He has a wonderful power of
economy in words. Throughout the plays,
and in the most memorable dialogues in the
novels, there is not a word too much, and
yet there is nothing jerky or scrappy in the
general impression.</p>

<p class='c001'>Galsworthy is not a writer who owes much
to outside influence. The first thought of
“influence” in his case calls up ideas of
French and Russian literature, but it would
be surer to say that the resemblance is due
to French and Russian qualities in the
author’s outlook and state of mind than to
discipleship either unconscious or deliberate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly he has that infinite pity, almost
reverence, for suffering which characterises
Russian ideas. But the same pity and
reverence are not expressed in the large,
straightforward manner of Tolstoy or
Dostoevsky, but with Gallic subtlety and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>irony, recalling Flaubert. The writer with
whom he has greatest affinity, to whom
he may be said to be to a certain extent
indebted, is Turguenev. In Turguenev we
see the meeting ground of French and
Russian art. There is the breadth, the
tenderness, the mysticism of the Slav,
mingling with the Frenchman’s sense of
humour and sense of form. Every writer
who sets store on form must expect to be
credited with French influences. English
art is essentially naïve in technique. Galsworthy
has few, if any, English affinities.
But, on the other hand, he has anglicised
the foreign influences. The Russian pity is
shorn of its mysticism, the French irony
of its gaiety. These two combinations are
characteristic of the countries of their origin,
and Galsworthy splits them, choosing the
pity and the irony, leaving the mysticism
and the gaiety—thus asserting both his
personality and his race.</p>

<p class='c001'>Galsworthy is a pessimist—not in the
spirit of fire and revolt, but in the spirit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>an artist, sad, rather hopeless, and compassionate.
Everywhere he sees ills—the
trampling of the weak and poor, the conflict
of instinct and civilisation, the pariahdom
of the enlightened, the tyranny of unimaginativeness,
hypocrisy and greed. He
suggests no remedy—in fact, he insists continually
on the difficulty of finding any
remedy which shall be at once permanent
and adequate—he just exposes the sore, and
shows at the same time his burning pity for
it, kindling our own.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if he realises with painful vividness
the evil and sorrow of life, and if a certain
tired hopelessness and dislike of interference
keep him from dreaming a brighter future,
his eyes are not blind to beauty, to tenderness,
and charm. Though his fine characters
are almost always in revolt, though his
beauty is always softened with pathos, his
rare humour twisted with satire, we must
acknowledge that he has a true sense of the
splendour, the loveliness, and the fun of
life. He sees them, so to speak, through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>mist of tears, but he does not miss them
altogether. It is because he is so much
more than a social reformer, because he is an
artist and a sensitive, that he cannot glibly
set down remedies for the world’s wrongs.
The genuine reformer is never content with
pointing out the evils of a system, he has an
improving plan. Galsworthy only shows
us the shadows, with the lights that lie
beside them, not those lights which shall
scatter them at last. He is an artist, and
the artist’s vision is not of the future, but
of to-day.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
